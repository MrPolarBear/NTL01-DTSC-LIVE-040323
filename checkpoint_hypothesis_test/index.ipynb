    "\n",
    "You are working for a natural resources ecology laboratory, with the goal of identifying new species of salamander. If a salamander sample seems to have different attributes than a similar, known species, then the laboratory can perform genetic testing to confirm the difference. This genetic testing is expensive, so they only want to use it when we have a statistically significant reason to believe that the sample is from a new species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting genetic testing, they want evidence that the sample is drawn from a different population than the known species â€” some unknown species. They are willing to conduct unnecessary genetic testing (where it turns out that the sample is actually from the known species) 20% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we will be using an 80% significance level, i.e. $\\alpha = 0.2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a new sample, and we want to know whether the sample is drawn from a population that is _smaller_ in length than the known species.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mean length of the known species is 90mm. This is also known as $\\mu_0$, the theoretical mean.\n",
    "* The standard deviation of the known species length is 30mm. This is also known as $\\sigma$ (sigma).\n",
    "* The mean length of the salamander sample is 87mm.\n",
